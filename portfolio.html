						The purpose of the book jacket design was to entice a targeted
						audience to explore a true story about my life while showcasing my
						personal aesthetic and creative abilities. The project required a
						balance between personal storytelling and professional presentation,
						ensuring that the design appealed to both potential publishing
						houses and specific readers with interests aligned to the themes of
						my memoir. By investigating the conventions of book jacket design,
						such as typography, layout, and imagery, I aimed to create a
						visually compelling and genre-appropriate design that could
						effectively capture the attention of my intended audience.

						This assignment of experimenting with type, layout, and image to
						create unorthodox designs played a crucial role in developing my
						creativity and problem-solving abilities as a designer. By stepping
						away from traditional design conventions, this exercise encouraged
						me to push boundaries and think outside the box. It challenged me to
						explore how unconventional design choices such as altering
						typography, breaking grid structures, or using unexpected image
						placements could still effectively communicate a message while
						engaging the audience in new ways.
