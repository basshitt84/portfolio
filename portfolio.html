					<p class="highlighted">A Story Of Love and Adventure</p>
					<p>
    This piece was written for my Spring 2025 Mythology class and reimagines a 
    mythic love story set against the backdrop of a divine conflict. Drawing on 
    themes of forbidden love, divine intervention, and heroic perseverance, I 
    crafted an original myth that feels rooted in classical Greek storytelling. 
    The narrative follows Elias and Katerina, two lovers separated by a sacred 
    dispute and a river created by Zeus himself. Inspired by mythological 
    archetypes and the symbolic guidance of gods like Hermes and Hera, the story 
    blends emotional depth with traditional mythic structure. This assignment 
    allowed me to explore world-building, symbolism, and the timeless patterns 
    that shape ancient and modern narratives.

					<p class="highlighted">Montage Theory</p>
					<p>
    This essay was written for my Non-Linear Video Editing class and examines why 
    the training montage in <em>Rocky IV</em> remains such an iconic example of 
    montage editing. Using Eisenstein’s theory and Karen Pearlman’s concepts from 
    <em>Cutting Rhythms</em>, I analyzed how the scene creates meaning through 
    contrast—Rocky’s natural, grit-filled training versus Drago’s cold, 
    machine-driven routine. I focused on rhythm, pacing, and emotional beats, and 
    how intuitive editing choices tell a story without relying on dialogue. 
    This project strengthened my understanding of montage as a storytelling tool 
    and deepened my appreciation for how editing shapes audience emotion.					</p>

					<p class="highlighted">Why Webdesign Fundamentals Still Matter In The Age Of Templates And AI</p>
					<p>
    This piece was written for my Writing on the Web course, where I explored why design fundamentals 
    still matter even with the rise of templates, page builders, and AI tools. Drawing on ideas from 
    Steve Krug’s <em>Don’t Make Me Think</em> and articles about the overwhelm of modern web development, 
    I explained how hierarchy, clarity, consistency, and accessibility are still at the core of usable 
    design. The assignment also connected to my own experience learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—showing 
    how tools can speed things up, but they don’t replace real understanding. Fundamentals are what keep 
    layouts intentional, fix issues when templates break, and create a clearer experience for users.

					<p>
    This speech was part of my second-semester IT course and was designed to build confidence in public speaking, 
    self-presentation, and overall professionalism. In the presentation, I talked about how my years of managing 
    in the service industry and performing as a musician taught me leadership, communication, and teamwork—skills 
    that directly support my growth as a web developer. I also shared the technical experience I’ve gained in HTML, 
    CSS, JavaScript, and data management, along with the success skills emphasized throughout the course, such as 
    time management, professionalism, and effective collaboration. Putting this speech together helped me get more 
    comfortable speaking in front of others while articulating who I am as a student, a teammate, and a future 
    professional in the field of web design and development.					</p>

    This presentation was part of a collaborative project, where my team redesigned the 
    Arkansas Space Grant Consortium website using WordPress. I served as the Project Manager and Team Lead, 
    coordinating our workflow and guiding the overall direction of the redesign. Our group focused on improving 
    navigation, simplifying content, and creating a more consistent user experience. I introduced the project 
    during our presentation and closed it out by summarizing our process and acknowledging our instructors and 
    client. This project strengthened my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills while giving me 
    hands-on experience managing a multi-stage design and development process with a real client.					</p>

					<p>
  This was my first client-based team project, and I served as the Team Leader 
  while my group and I designed and developed a complete website for Buffalo 
  Basecamp. We worked directly with the client to understand their goals, 
  target audience, and overall vision, then translated that into a functional 
  and user-friendly site. I handled the front-end development — building the 
  structure, creating responsive layouts, and ensuring the design felt clean 
  and intuitive using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leading the team taught me a 
  great deal about communication, organization, and keeping a project moving 
  forward, while working with a real client helped me develop the professionalism 
  and problem-solving skills needed to turn client needs into a cohesive final 
  product.				</div>

					<p>
  This microsite was a solo project I completed in my IT coursework, where I built 
  a small multi-page website focused on the Cossatot River State Park–Natural Area. 
  It pushed me to strengthen my front-end development skills, especially in creating 
  a consistent layout across multiple pages and organizing content in a clear, 
  user-friendly way. I handled everything — the structure, design, and coding — 
  using HTML and CSS, which helped me become more comfortable working independently 
  and problem-solving without relying on templates or builders. This project was an 
  important step in building confidence with multi-page navigation, responsive 
  layout decisions, and overall site organization.					</p>

  This Unit Conversion Calculator was part of my JavaScript coursework where we 
  worked closely with Mr. Bauer to develop stronger problem-solving and scripting 
  skills. The project required building an interactive web form that takes user 
  input, validates it, and sends a request to a server-side API to return accurate 
  unit conversions. I handled the HTML structure, styled the layout with CSS, and 
  wrote the JavaScript needed to manage form behavior, error handling, and 
  asynchronous requests. This assignment helped me understand how front-end logic 
  communicates with external data sources, and it strengthened my confidence in 
  writing cleaner, more organized JavaScript.				</div>

  This Currency Value History project was part of my coursework last semester, 
  and it helped strengthen my confidence in working with JavaScript and external 
  data sources. The goal was to build a simple tool that lets users choose a 
  currency and instantly see how its value has changed over time. I created the 
  layout with HTML and CSS, then used JavaScript to fetch data from an API, 
  update the interface based on user selections, and turn the raw numbers into 
  something clear and useful. This project pushed me to understand asynchronous 
  programming better and gave me valuable experience turning live data into a 
  clean, functional feature on a webpage.					</p>

						 This Jewelry Database project was part of my coursework with Mr. Bauer last 
                         semester, where we learned the fundamentals of building and organizing 
                         databases using Google Sheets. The goal was to structure real-world data in a 
                         clear, searchable format while applying concepts like sorting, filtering, 
                        formulas, and data validation. This project helped me understand how a 
                        well-designed spreadsheet can function as a lightweight database and how 
                        important clean structure is when working with large sets of information. It 
                        also strengthened my ability to organize data logically and present it in a 
                        way that is easy to read and work with — skills that translate directly into 
                        web development and problem-solving.

  This Safety Products Database project was completed under the guidance of Mr. 
  Bauer last semester and included building structured data in Google Sheets and 
  visualizing it using graphs. I organized the data for South University Autorama’s 
  product records — applying sorting, filtering, and data validation — and then 
  created charts to highlight trends and insights in the data. This process deepened 
  my understanding of how data organization, visualization, and clean structure 
  contribute to clarity and usability. I learned how to turn raw data into meaningful, 
  easy-to-understand visuals — a skill that bridges database work and user-focused 
  design, which I consider essential as I grow towards full-stack development.

  For the Ticket Sales project, I worked with sales data from Park Plaza Mall
  and used Google Sheets to build a clean, organized database that tracked
  transactions, dates, and customer information. I applied data-management
  techniques such as sorting, filtering, and validation to ensure accuracy,
  and then created visual summaries to highlight trends and patterns in the
  dataset. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how structured
  data and clear visualizations can turn raw numbers into meaningful insights,
  a skill that connects directly to problem-solving in web design and
  development.

						For my Capstone project, my team and I partnered with the Arkansas Space Grant
  Consortium to redesign their entire website with a focus on clarity,
  usability, and professionalism. As the Project Manager and Team Lead, I
  coordinated communication with our client, organized our workflow, and guided
  the direction of the site throughout the conceptualization, development, and
  demo phases. Working with Genesis Pro, Elementor, and WordPress taught us how
  to balance design goals with technical limitations while keeping the user
  experience at the center of every decision. This project strengthened my
  leadership skills, expanded my front-end development abilities, and gave me
  real-world experience collaborating with a client to deliver a functional,
  well-structured website built to support students, educators, and NASA-aligned
  programs across Arkansas.
